### App Features
1. Fetching Breaking News
The app fetches the latest breaking news articles from the News API and displays them in a list format. Each article in the list includes the following details:

- Image: The article's thumbnail or representative image.
- Title: The headline or title of the article.
- Date: The publication date of the article.
- Description: A short description or summary of the article's content.

2. Viewing Full Article
When the user clicks on an article in the list, the app displays the full article, including the complete text, images, and any additional details available. This allows users to read the entire article within the app.

3. Save to Read Later
Each article in the list has a "Save to Read Later" button. When clicked, the article is saved for later reading in a persistent format. This means that even if the user closes the app and reopens it later, the saved articles will still be accessible.

4. Read Later List
The app provides a separate section or screen where users can view all the articles they have saved for later reading. Clicking on any article in the "Read Later" list displays the full article, allowing users to read it without searching for it again.

5. Search by Title
The app includes a search feature that allows users to search for articles by title. Users can enter keywords or phrases related to the article's title, and the app filters the list of articles to display only those matching the search query.

6. Sorting by Date
To enhance user experience, the app offers the ability to sort the breaking news articles by date and publication. Users can choose to view articles in ascending or descending order based on their preference.

7. Offline Caching
In case of no internet connection, the app caches news articles locally on the user's device. This allows users to continue browsing and reading articles even when they are offline.
